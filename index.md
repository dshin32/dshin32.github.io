<!-- ### Introduction -->

My name is Donghyuk Shin (신동혁). I currently work at Amazon as a Machine Learning Scientist. 

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu), where I was advised by [Prof. Inderjit S. Dhillon](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/inderjit) and part of the [Center for Big Data Analytics](http://bigdata.ices.utexas.edu/). Before then, I received my B.E. and M.S. degrees from [Sogang University](http://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr). 
My research interests primarily focus on the field of machine learning and data mining, particularly in recommender systems, social network analysis, forecasting and big data analytics. I am also interested in the field of business analytics and management information systems and have closely worked with [Prof. Andrew B. Whinston](https://sites.google.com/site/abwhinston/).
