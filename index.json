Drawing on the literature of information systems and marketing, complemented with data-driven methods, we propose a number of visual and textual content features including complexity, similarity, and consistency measures that can play important roles in the persuasiveness of social media content. We then employ state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as deep learning and text mining to operationalize these new content features in a scalable and systematic manner. For the newly developed features, we validate them against human coders on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies with a large social media dataset from Tumblr to show the effectiveness of the proposed content features. The first case study demonstrates that both theoretically motivated and data-driven features significantly improve the model's power to predict the popularity of a post, and the second one highlights the relationships between content features and consumer evaluations of the corresponding posts. The proposed research framework illustrates how deep learning methods can enhance the analysis of unstructured visual and textual data for social media research.","tags":[],"title":"Enhancing Social Media Analysis with Visual Data Analytics: A Deep Learning Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Nonetheless, whether and how social media metrics on customer attitude toward the company has not been thoroughly examined. This study develops a new index of customer satisfaction by using sentiment and content analyses of customer-generated social media content. Across multiple social media platforms, we found that positive testimonials (i.e., \"Likes\" from Facebook) and positive blogs have statistically positive associations with customer satisfaction, while customer complaints (from Facebook), negative blogs, and negative tweets are negatively associated with it by using a semiparametric model. Furthermore, we found that the proposed customer satisfaction index based on social media metrics is positively and statistically associated with firm's market performance. In addition, we suggest that the new social media metrics about customer attitude toward the company would strongly complement existing customer satisfaction index such as ACSI.","tags":[],"title":"Customer Attitude from Social Media, Customer Satisfaction Index and Firm Value","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Our study focuses on company-generated posts, which consist of two main information sources: visual (images) and textual (text and tags). We employ state-of-the-art machine learning approaches including deep learning to extract data-driven features from both sources that effectively capture their semantics in a systematic and scalable manner. With such semantic representations, we develop novel complexity, similarity, and consistency measures of social media content. Our empirical results show that proper visual stimuli (e.g., beautiful images, adult-content, celebrities, etc.), complementary textual content, and consistent themes have positive effects on the engagement, and that content demanding significant concentration levels (e.g., video, images with complex semantics, text with diverse topics, complex sentences, etc.) have the opposite effects. This work contributes to the literature by exemplifying how unstructured multimedia data can be translated into insights. Our framework for semantic content analysis, particularly for visual content, illustrates how to leverage deep learning methods to better model and analyze multimedia data for effective marketing and social media strategies.","tags":[],"title":"Analyzing Content and Customer Engagement in Social Media with Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Due to the sheer amount of posts created on such services, an important task is to make quality recommendations of blogs for users to follow. Apart from traditional recommender system settings where the follower graph is the main data source, additional side-information of users and blogs such as user activity (e.g., like and reblog) and rich content (e.g., text and images) are also available to be exploited for enhanced recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel boosted inductive matrix completion method (BIMC) for blog recommendation. BIMC is an additive low-rank model for user-blog preferences consisting of two components; one component captures the low-rank structure of follow relationships and the other captures the latent structure using side-information. Our model formulation combines the power of the recently proposed inductive matrix completion (IMC) model (for side-information) together with a standard matrix completion (MC) model (for low-rank structure). Furthermore, we utilize recently developed deep learning techniques to obtain semantically rich feature representations of text and images that are incorporated in BIMC. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset from Tumblr illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed BIMC method.","tags":[],"title":"Tumblr Blog Recommendation with Boosted Inductive Matrix Completion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel multi-scale spectral decomposition method (MSEIGS), which first clusters the graph into smaller clusters whose spectral decomposition can be computed efficiently and independently. We show theoretically as well as empirically that the union of all cluster’s subspaces has significant overlap with the dominant subspace of the original graph, provided that the graph is clustered appropriately. Thus, eigenvectors of the clusters serve as good initializations to a block Lanczos algorithm that is used to compute spectral decomposition of the original graph. We further use hierarchical clustering to speed up the computation and adopt a fast early termination strategy to compute quality approximations. Our method outperforms widely used solvers in terms of convergence speed and approximation quality. Furthermore, our method is naturally parallelizable and exhibits significant speedups in shared-memory parallel settings. For example, on a graph with more than 82 million nodes and 3.6 billion edges, MSEIGS takes less than 3 hours on a single-core machine while Randomized SVD takes more than 6 hours, to obtain a similar approximation of the top-50 eigenvectors. Using 16 cores, we can reduce this time to less than 40 minutes.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Scale Spectral Decomposition of Massive Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N. Natarajan*","D.

More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the _current_ context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session _interactional context_. It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic _representational_ context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the _iConRank_ algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate _context bias_, in addition to _click bias_ (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm, where we achieve at least 20% (up to 37%) improvement over competitive methods in the recall level at top-20.","tags":[],"title":"Which App Will You Use Next?

The scale of these social networks is massive and continues to grow rapidly. An important problem in social network analysis is proximity estimation that infers the closeness of different users. Link prediction, in turn, is an important application of proximity estimation. However, many methods for computing proximity measures have high computational complexity and are thus prohibitive for large-scale link prediction problems. One way to address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank approximation. However, a single low-rank approximation may not be sufficient to represent the behavior of the entire network. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Link Prediction (MSLP), a framework for link prediction, which can handle massive networks. The basic idea of MSLP is to construct low-rank approximations of the network at _multiple scales_ in an efficient manner. To achieve this, we propose a fast tree-structured approximation algorithm. Based on this approach, MSLP combines predictions at multiple scales to make robust and accurate predictions. Experimental results on real-life datasets with more than a million nodes show the superior performance and scalability of our method.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-scale Link Prediction","type":"publication"}]
