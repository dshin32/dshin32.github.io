Social commerce generally refers to online commerce applications that harness social media and Web 2.0 technologies. The phenomena of increased social interactions and purchase behavior on social commerce are especially visible as consumers are practicing the stay-at-home order, which leads to critical questions businesses need to ask: when physical shopping and in-person social interactions are restrained by the current policies, how are e-commerce activities and online social activities affected? Using granular social clickstream data from a US-based, international social commerce platform, we evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on consumer social activities and purchase decisions. Our findings indicate that more socially connected consumers are more valuable to businesses and tend to make more purchase, give higher product rating, and produce higher-quality review content during the COVID-19 pandemic; we uncover the moderating effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the sentiment and content length for different types of social commerce posting. We found that consumers tend to post longer content and have a more positive sentiment when posting product reviews compare to other types of social postings during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial standpoint, our findings have important implications for the design of social commerce sites in future pandemic crises as consumers with a higher level of social connectivity are especially valuable and should be well maintained. Furthermore, we provide insights on how social commerce sites should regulate social activities under a pandemic to promote higher sales and more positive social content.">

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Under the COVID-19 crisis, the evolution of e-commerce in the digital economy has driven social commerce as a new paradigm. Social commerce generally refers to online commerce applications that harness social media and Web 2.0 technologies. The phenomena of increased social interactions and purchase behavior on social commerce are especially visible as consumers are practicing the stay-at-home order, which leads to critical questions businesses need to ask: when physical shopping and in-person social interactions are restrained by the current policies, how are e-commerce activities and online social activities affected? Using granular social clickstream data from a US-based, international social commerce platform, we evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on consumer social activities and purchase decisions. Our findings indicate that more socially connected consumers are more valuable to businesses and tend to make more purchase, give higher product rating, and produce higher-quality review content during the COVID-19 pandemic; we uncover the moderating effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the sentiment and content length for different types of social commerce posting. We found that consumers tend to post longer content and have a more positive sentiment when posting product reviews compare to other types of social postings during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial standpoint, our findings have important implications for the design of social commerce sites in future pandemic crises as consumers with a higher level of social connectivity are especially valuable and should be well maintained. Furthermore, we provide insights on how social commerce sites should regulate social activities under a pandemic to promote higher sales and more positive social content.</p>
