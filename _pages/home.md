### Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor with the <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3518573">Department of Information Systems</a> in the <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/">W. P. Carey School of Business</a> at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>. 
My research interests are in the intersection of machine learning (ML) and information systems.
 <!-- with the goal of understanding complex phenomena using ML and developing novel ML methods.  -->
Topics include but are not limited to artificial intelligence, digital platforms, educational technology, and their business and societal impacts. In my research, I use ML, econometric analysis, and randomized field experiments.

Before joining ASU, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (2016-2019), where I developed and implemented ML systems to understand and serve customer needs on the world's lergest Cloud.
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/">Prof. Inderjit S. Dhillon</a> and part of the <a href="https://bigdata.oden.utexas.edu/">Center for Big Data Analytics</a>. During my Ph.D. studies, I had also closely worked with <a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/Directory/Profiles/Whinston-Andrew">Prof. Andrew B. Whinston</a> and spent time at <a href="https://research.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Research</a> (2014) and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon</a> (2013).
